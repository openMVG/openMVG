.SH NAME
\fBgout \fP- output graphics from matrices and graphs
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBgout\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIgfile\fP] [\fIxfile\fP] [\fImfile\fP] [\fIvfile\fP]
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgout\fP program creates graphics files of various types,
representing the Scotch graph and mapping data which is passed to it.
.PP
Source graph file \fIgfile\fP can only be a centralized graph file. File
\fIxfile\fP stores its associated geometry, whenever necessary. File
\fImfile\fP represents label information attached to each of the graph
vertices, for instance the index of the part to which each vertex
belongs in the case of a mapping file. File \fIvfile\fP is the output
graphics file, the type of which may differ according to the input
parameters. When file names are not specified, data is read from
standard input and written to standard output. Standard streams can
also be explicitly represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, gtst
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).

.SH EXAMPLES
Build an OpenInventor file of the mapping of graph brol.grf
contained in file brol.map. Vertices with no mapping information
attached to them will be rendered in white, while distinct colors
will be used to represent the different parts. Cut edges will be
removed:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ gout '-oi{r}' brol.grf brol.xyz brol.map brol.iv
    $ ivview brol.iv

.fam T
.fi
Build an OpenInventor file of graph brol.grf without any vertex
information associated to it. Mapping data are not required and
will not be read, but a file name has to be provided, hence the
'-':
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ gout -oi -mn brol.grf brol.xyz - brol.iv

.fam T
.fi
Output the pattern of matrix brol.grf on the form of a PostScript
flat drawing. Geometry and mapping data are not required and will
not be read, but file names have to be provided, hence the
two '-'s:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ gout -om -gn -mn brol.grf - - brol.ps

.fam T
.fi
Output a PostScript 2D drawing of a rectangular portion graph
brol.grf, with disks representing mapping data:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ gout '-op{c,e,d,x=0.3,X=0.6,y=0.2,Y=0.5}' brol.grf brol.xyz brol.map brol.ps
