.SH NAME
\fBmtst \fP- test the consistency of source meshes
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBmtst\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fImfile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmtst\fP program checks, in a sequential way, the consistency of a
Scotch source mesh and, in case of success, outputs some statistics
regarding edge weights, node and element vertex weights, and node
and element vertex degrees.
.PP
Source mesh file \fImfile\fP can only be a centralized mesh file. The
resulting statistics are stored in file \fIlfile\fP. When file names are
not specified, data is read from standard input and written to
standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitly
represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBmtst\fP
can directly handle compressed meshes, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.msh.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
