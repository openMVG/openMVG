.SH NAME
\fBgtst \fP- test the consistency of source graphs
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBgtst\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIgfile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgtst\fP program checks, in a sequential way, the consistency of a
Scotch source graph and, in case of success, outputs some statistics
regarding edge weights, vertex weights, and vertex degrees.
.PP
It produces the very same results as the \fBdgtst\fP(1) program of the
PT-Scotch parallel distribution, but unlike this latter it cannot
handle distributed graphs.
.PP
Source graph file \fIgfile\fP can only be a centralized graph file. The
resulting statistics are stored in file \fIlfile\fP. When file names are
not specified, data is read from standard input and written to
standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitly
represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBgtst\fP
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
