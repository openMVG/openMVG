\fBgcv \fP- graph file converter

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgcv\fP program converts Scotch graph files from and to other
external file formats.
.PP
File \fIigfile\fP is converted into graph file \fIogfile\fP, with optional
geometry data being put in geometry file \fIoxfile\fP, if it is
available.
.PP
When file names are not specified, data is read from standard input
and written to standard output. Standard streams can also be
explicitly represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, dgtst
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.SH OPTIONS

\fB-h\fP
Display some help.
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP\fIifmt\fP
Set format of input graph file, which can be:
.RS
.TP
.B
b\fInum\fP
Boeing-Harwell format. This is a matrix format.
Only square matrices are supported. Square matrices
with unsymmetric pattern are symmetrized. In
case the file contains several matrices, the \fInum\fP
parameter allow the user to provide the index of
the matrix to convert, starting from 0. When the \fInum\fP
parameter is not set, it is assumed to be 0.
.TP
.B
c
Chaco format. This is an adjacency graph
format, also used by MeTiS.
.TP
.B
m
Matrix Market format. This is a matrix format
describing individual edges. Matrix pattern is
symmetrized, such that rectangular matrices are
eventually squared.
.TP
.B
s
Scotch graph format. This is an adjacency graph format.

.SH EXAMPLE
Convert a Matrix Market graph into a Scotch graph. Matrix Market
files do not comprise geometry data, so no geometry file is needed
on output:
