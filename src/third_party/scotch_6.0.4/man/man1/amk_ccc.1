.SH DESCRIPTION
The amk_* programs create target architecture files for some common,
regular topologies.
.PP
\fBamk_ccc\fP creates a decomposition-defined cube-connected-cycle
topology of dimension \fIdim\fP. The decomposition is performed first by
bisection along the dimensions of the hypercube, then along the
remaining cycle graphs.
.PP
\fBamk_fft2\fP creates a decomposition-defined fast-Fourier-transform
topology of dimension \fIdim\fP. The decomposition is performed by
recursive bisection of the vertices, by descending dimension
(that is, bit number in the labeling of the vertices).
.PP
\fBamk_hy\fP creates a decomposition-defined hypercube topology of
dimension \fIdim\fP. The decomposition is performed by
recursive bisection of the vertices, by descending dimension
(that is, bit number in the labeling of the vertices). Save for
experimentation purposes, this program is deprecated, as the
algorithmically-defined 'hcub' target architecture is a more
convenient and efficient way to represent hypercube architectures.
.PP
\fBamk_m2\fP creates a decomposition-defined 2D regular grid topology of
dimensions \fIdimX\fP and \fIdimY\fP. The decomposition is performed by
recursive splitting along the dimensions, either by cutting the
longest one, or by one-way dissection, depending on the '\fB-m\fP' option
flag. Save for experimentation purposes, this program is deprecated,
as the algorithmically-defined 'mesh2D' and 'mesh3D' target
architectures are a more convenient and efficient way to represent
2D and 3D grid architectures.
.PP
\fBamk_p2\fP creates a weighted path graph topology comprising only two
vertices of weights \fIwght0\fP and \fIwght1\fP. This is just a helper program,
which builds a 'wcmplt' algorithmically-defined complete graph with
two vertices. It may be used to compute weighted bisections of a
graph.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH EXAMPLE
Create a cube-connected-cycle target architecture of dimension 4,
and save it to file 'ccc4.tgt'.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ amk_ccc 4 ccc4.tgt

.fam T
.fi
Run gmap to compute a bisection, into two parts of respective weights
3 and 5, of graph 'brol.grf' and save the resulting mapping to
file 'brol.map'. The dash '-' standard file name is used so that the
target architecture description is read from the standard input,
through the pipe.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ amk_p2 3 5 | gmap brol.grf - brol.map
