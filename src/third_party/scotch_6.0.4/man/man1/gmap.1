.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgmap\fP program computes, in a sequential way, a static mapping of a
source graph onto a target graph.
.PP
The \fBgpart\fP program is a shortcut of \fBgmap\fP for computing unweighted
partitions of a source graph.
.PP
Source graph file \fIgfile\fP can only be a centralized graph file. For \fBgmap\fP,
the target architecture file \fItfile\fP describes either algorithmically-coded
topologies such as meshes and hypercubes, or decomposition-defined
architectures created by means of the \fBamk_grf\fP(1) program. The resulting
mapping is stored in file \fImfile\fP. Eventual logging information (such
as the one produced by option \fB-v\fP) is sent to file \fIlfile\fP. When file
names are not specified, data is read from standard input and
written to standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitely
represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBgmap\fP
and \fBgpart\fP can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and
output. A stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is
postfixed with a compressed file extension, such as
in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The compression formats which can be
supported are the bzip2 format ('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'),
and the lzma format ('.lzma', on input only).

.SH TARGET ARCHITECTURES
Target architectures represent graphs onto which source graphs are
mapped. In order to speed-up the obtainment of target architecture
topological properties during the computation of mappings, some
classical topologies are algorithmically coded into the mapper
itself. These topologies are consequently simply defined by their
code name, followed by their dimensional parameters:
.TP
.B
cmplt \fIdim\fP
unweighted complete graph of size \fIdim\fP.
.TP
.B
cmpltw \fIdim\fP \fIw0\fP \fIw1\fP \.\.\. \fIwdim-1\fP
weighted complete graph of size
size and of respective loads
\fIw0\fP, \fIw1\fP, \.\.\., \fIwdim-1\fP.
.TP
.B
hcub \fIdim\fP

with (\fIn0\fP times \fIn1\fP times \.\.\. \fInhgt-1\fP)
vertices, with inter-cluster link
weights of \fIw0\fP, \fIw1\fP, \.\.\. \fIwhgt-1\fP.

.TP

torus2D \fIdimX\fP \fIdimY\fP
2D torus of \fIdimX\fP times \fIdimY\fP nodes.
.TP
.B
torus3D \fIdimX\fP \fIdimY\fP \fIdimZ\fP
3D torus of \fIdimX\fP times \fIdimY\fP times \fIdimZ\fP nodes.
.PP
Other target topologies can be created from their source graph
description by using the \fBamk_grf\fP(1) command. In this case, the
target description will begin with the code name \fBdeco\fP.
.SH MAPPINGS
Mappings are represented by as many lines as there are vertices in
the source graph. Each of these lines is made of two figures: the
number of the vertex (or its label if source graph vertices are
labeled) and the index of the target vertex to which it has been
assigned. Target vertex indices range from 0 to the number of
vertices in the target architecture (that is, the number of parts)
minus one.
.PP
This block of lines is always preceded by the number of such
lines. In most cases, since full mappings are requested, the number
of lines is equal to the number of vertices in the source graph.
.SH EXAMPLES
Run \fBgpart\fP to compute a partition into 7 parts of graph 'brol.grf' and
save the resulting ordering to file 'brol.map'.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ gpart 7 brol.grf brol.map

.fam T
.fi
Run \fBgmap\fP to compute a partition, into 3 parts of respective weights
1, 2 and 4, of graph 'brol.grf' and save the resulting mapping to
file 'brol.map'. The dash '-' standard file name is used so that the
target architecture description is read from the standard input,
through the pipe, as provided by the 'echo' shell command.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ echo "cmpltw 3 1 2 4" | gmap brol.grf - brol.map
