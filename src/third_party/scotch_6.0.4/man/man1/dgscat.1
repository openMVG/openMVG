.SH NAME
\fBdgscat \fP- build distributed source graph file fragments from a centralized source graph file
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdgscat\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIigfile\fP] [\fIogfile\fP]
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdgscat\fP program reads a centralized source graph \fIigfile\fP and
writes it back on the form of a set of files \fIogfile\fP representing
fragments of a distributed source graph.
.PP
When file names are not specified, data is read from standard input
and written to standard output. Standard streams can also be
explicitly represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, dgord
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.PP
dgord bases on implementations of the MPI interface to spread work
across the processing elements. It is therefore not likely to be run
directly, but instead through some launcher command such as \fBmpirun\fP.
.SH DISTRIBUTED FILE NAMES
In order to tell whether programs should read from, or write to, a
single file located on only one processor, or to multiple instances
of the same file on all of the processors, or else to distinct files
on each of the processors, a special grammar has been designed,
which is based on the '%' escape character. Four such escape
sequences are defined, which are interpreted independently on every
processor, prior to file opening. By default, when a filename is
provided, it is assumed that the file is to be opened on only one of
the processors, called the root processor, which is usually process
0 of the communicator within which the program is run. The index
of the root processor can be changed by means of the \fB-r\fP
option. Using any of the first three escape sequences below will
instruct programs to open in parallel a file of name equal to the
interpreted filename, on every processor on which they are run.
.TP
.B
%p
Replaced by the number of processes in the global communicator in
which the program is run. Leads to parallel opening.
.TP
.B
%r
Replaced on each process running the program by the rank of this
process in the global communicator. Leads to parallel opening.
.TP
.B
%-
Discarded, but leads to parallel opening. This sequence is mainly
used to instruct programs to open on every processor a file of
identical name. The opened files can be, according whether the
given path leads to a shared directory or to directories that
are local to each processor, either to the opening of multiple
instances of the same file, or to the opening of distinct files
which may each have a different content, respectively (but in
this latter case it is much recommended to identify files by
means of the '%r' sequence).
.TP
.B
%%
Replaced by a single '%' character. File names using this escape
sequence are not considered for parallel opening, unless one or
several of the three other escape sequences are also present.
.RE
.PP
For instance, filename 'brol' will lead to the opening of file 'brol'
on the root processor only, filename '%\fB-brol\fP' (or even 'br%\fB-ol\fP') will
lead to the parallel opening of files called 'brol' on every
processor, and filename 'brol%p-%r' will lead to the opening of files
'brol2-0' and 'brol2-1', respectively, on each of the two processors
on which the program were to run.
