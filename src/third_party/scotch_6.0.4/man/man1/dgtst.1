.SH NAME
\fBdgtst \fP- test the consistency of source graphs in parallel
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBdgtst\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIgfile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdgtst\fP program checks, in a parallel way, the consistency of a
Scotch source graph and, in case of success, outputs some statistics
regarding edge weights, vertex weights, and vertex degrees.
.PP
It produces the very same results as the \fBgtst\fP(1) program of the
Scotch sequential distribution, but unlike this latter it can handle
distributed graphs.
.PP
Source graph file \fIgfile\fP is either a centralized graph file, or a set
of files representing fragments of a distributed graph. The
resulting statistics are stored in file \fIlfile\fP. When file names are
not specified, data is read from standard input and written to
standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitly
represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBdgtst\fP
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.PP
\fBdgtst\fP bases on implementations of the MPI interface to spread work
across the processing elements. It is therefore not likely to be run
directly, but instead through some launcher command such as \fBmpirun\fP.

.SH EXAMPLE
Run \fBdgtst\fP on 5 processing elements to test the consistency of graph brol.grf
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ mpirun -np 5 dgtst brol.grf

.fam T
.fi
Run dgord on 5 processing elements to test the consistency of a
distributed graph stored on graph fragment files brol5-0.dgr to
brol5-4.dgr, and save the resulting ordering to file brol.ord (see
\fBdgscat\fP(1) for an explanation of the '%p' and '%r' sequences in names
of distributed graph fragments).
