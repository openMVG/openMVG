.SH NAME
\fBatst \fP- test the consistency of target architectures
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBatst\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIafile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBatst\fP program checks the consistency of a Scotch
decomposition-defined target architecture and, in case of success,
outputs some statistics regarding the number of target vertices and
the length of paths linking them. Target architectures define the
topology of the target graphs used by static mapping programs
\fBgmap\fP(1) and \fBdgmap\fP(1).
.PP
The resulting statistics are stored in file \fIlfile\fP. When file names
are not specified, data is read from standard input and written to
standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitly represented
by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBatst\fP
can directly handle compressed files, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.tgt.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
