.SH NAME
\fBgomtst \fP- compute statistics on sparse matrix orderings
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBgotst\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIgfile\fP] [\fIofile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgotst\fP program computes, in a sequential way, statistics on a
sparse matrix ordering, such as fill-in, operation count, and
separator tree parameters: minimum, maximum, average height and
variance of its leaves.
.PP
Source graph file \fIgfile\fP can only be a centralized graph file. File
\fIofile\fP represents the ordering of the symmetric sparse matrix the
pattern of which is represented by \fIgfile\fP. The resulting statistics
are stored in file \fIlfile\fP. When file names are not specified, data is
read from standard input and written to standard output. Standard
streams can also be explicitly represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, gtst
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.PP
Since \fBgotst\fP performs sequentially the symbolic factorization of
matrix \fIgfile\fP in order to compute fill-in and operation count
numbers, this program can take a long time or even run out of memory,
when applied to very large graphs.
