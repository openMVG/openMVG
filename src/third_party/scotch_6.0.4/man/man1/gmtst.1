.SH NAME
\fBgmtst \fP- compute statistics on mappings
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBgmtst\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIgfile\fP] [\fItfile\fP] [\fImfile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgmtst\fP program computes, in a sequential way, statistics on a
static mapping, such as load imbalance ratio, edge dilation
distribution, etc. It yields the same results as the ones produced
by the \fB-vm\fP option of the \fBgmap\fP(1) program.
.PP
Source graph file \fIgfile\fP can only be a centralized graph file. File
\fItfile\fP represents the target architecture onto which \fIgfile\fP was
mapped. If mapping file \fImfile\fP was produced by \fBgpart\fP(1), the target
architecture file to provide \fBgmtst\fP should describe a complete graph
with the same number of vertices as the requested number of parts,
for instance by means of the '\fBcmplt\fP \fInum\fP' algorithmically-described
architecture. The resulting statistics are stored in file
\fIlfile\fP. When file names are not specified, data is read from standard
input and written to standard output. Standard streams can also be
explicitly represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, gtst
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).

.SH EXAMPLES
Display statistics on mapping brol.map of graph brol.grf onto target
architecture brol.tgt:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ gmtst brol.grf brol.tgt brol.map

.fam T
.fi
Display statistics on partitioning brol.map of graph brol.grf into
\fInum\fP parts. Note the use of the complete graph
algorithmically-described architecture and of the shell pipe command
to provide the complete target architecture description on the
standard input of the \fBgmtst\fP command:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ echo "cmplt num" | gmtst brol.grf - brol.map

.fam T
