.SH NAME
\fBmord \fP- compute sparse matrix orderings of meshes
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBmord\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fImfile\fP] [\fIofile\fP] [\fIlfile\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmord\fP program computes, in a sequential way, an ordering of a
Scotch source mesh representing the pattern of some symmetric sparse
matrix. Only nodes of the mesh are effectively ordered. Elements
provide connectivity information, such that every node is considered
to be linked to all of the nodes which share at least an element
with it.
.PP
Source mesh file \fImfile\fP can only be a centralized mesh file. The
resulting ordering is stored in file \fIofile\fP. Eventual logging
information (such as the one produced by option \fB-v\fP) is sent to file
\fIlfile\fP. When file names are not specified, data is read from standard
input and written to standard output. Standard streams can also be
explicitely represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, gord
can directly handle compressed meshes, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.msh.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-c\fPopt
Choose default ordering strategy according to one or
several \fIoptions\fP among:
.RS
.TP
.B
b
enforce load balance as much as possible.
.TP
.B
q
privilege quality over speed (default).
.TP
.B
s
privilege speed over quality.
.TP
.B
t
enforce safety.
.RE
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP
Display some help.
.TP
.B
\fB-m\fP\fImfile\fP
Save column block mapping data to file \fImfile\fP. Mapping data
specifies, for each node vertex, the index of the column
block to which this node vertex belongs.
.TP
.B
\fB-o\fP\fIstrat\fP
Use sequential mesh ordering strategy \fIstrat\fP (see
Scotch user's manual for more information).
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP\fItfile\fP
Save partitioning tree data to file \fItfile\fP. Partitioning
tree data specifies, for each node vertex, the index of the
first node vertex of the parent block of the block to which
the node vertex belongs. Altogether with the mapping data
provided in file \fImfile\fP, it allows one to rebuild the
separator tree of the nested dissection process.
.TP
.B
\fB-V\fP
Display program version and copyright.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP\fIverb\fP
Set verbose mode to \fIverb\fP. It is a set of one of more
characters which can be:
.RS
.TP
.B
s
strategy information.
.TP
.B
t
timing information.
.SH EXAMPLE
Reorder matrix mesh brol.msh and save the resulting ordering to
file brol.ord using the default sequential mesh ordering strategy:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ mord brol.msh brol.ord

.fam T
.fi
