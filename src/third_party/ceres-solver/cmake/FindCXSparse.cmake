# FindCXSparse.cmake - Find CXSparse libraries & dependencies.
#
# This module defines the following variables which should be referenced
# by the caller to use the library.
#
# CXSPARSE_FOUND: TRUE iff CXSparse and all dependencies have been found.
# CXSPARSE_INCLUDE_DIRS: Include directories for CXSparse.
# CXSPARSE_LIBRARIES: Libraries for CXSparse and all dependencies.
#
# CXSPARSE_VERSION: Extracted from cs.h.
# CXSPARSE_MAIN_VERSION: Equal to 3 if CXSPARSE_VERSION = 3.1.2
# CXSPARSE_SUB_VERSION: Equal to 1 if CXSPARSE_VERSION = 3.1.2
# CXSPARSE_SUBSUB_VERSION: Equal to 2 if CXSPARSE_VERSION = 3.1.2
#
# The following variables control the behaviour of this module:
#
# CXSPARSE_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                             search for CXSparse includes,
#                             e.g: /timbuktu/include.
# CXSPARSE_LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                             search for CXSparse libraries, e.g: /timbuktu/lib.
#
# The following variables are also defined by this module, but in line with
# CMake recommended FindPackage() module style should NOT be referenced directly
# by callers (use the plural variables detailed above instead).  These variables
# do however affect the behaviour of the module via FIND_[PATH/LIBRARY]() which
# are NOT re-called (i.e. search for library is not repeated) if these variables
# are set with valid values _in the CMake cache_. This means that if these
# variables are set directly in the cache, either by the user in the CMake GUI,
# or by the user passing -DVAR=VALUE directives to CMake when called (which
# explicitly defines a cache variable), then they will be used verbatim,
# bypassing the HINTS variables and other hard-coded search locations.
#
# CXSPARSE_INCLUDE_DIR: Include directory for CXSparse, not including the
#                       include directory of any dependencies.
# CXSPARSE_LIBRARY: CXSparse library, not including the libraries of any
#                   dependencies.

# FindCXSparse was invoked.
