Version History
===============

1.10.0
======

New Features
------------
#. Ceres Solver can now be used to solve general unconstrained
   optimization problems. See the documentation for
   ``GradientProblem`` and ``GradientProblemSolver``.
#. ``Eigen`` can now be as a sparse linear algebra backend. This can
   be done by setting
   ``Solver::Options::sparse_linear_algebra_library_type`` to
   ``EIGEN_SPARSE``. Performance should be comparable to ``CX_SPARSE``.

   .. NOTE::

      Because ``Eigen`` is a header only library, and some of the code
      related to sparse Cholesky factorization is LGPL, building Ceres
      with support for Eigen's sparse linear algebra is disabled by
      default and should be enabled explicitly.

   .. NOTE::

      For good performance, use Eigen version 3.2.2 or later.

#. Added ``EIGEN_SPARSE_QR`` algorithm for covariance estimation using
   ``Eigen``'s sparse QR factorization. (Michael Vitus)
#. Faster inner iterations when using multiple threads.
#. Faster ``ITERATIVE_SCHUR`` + ``SCHUR_JACOBI`` for small to medium
   sized problems (see documentation for
   ``Solver::Options::use_explicit_schur_complement``).
#. Faster automatic Schur ordering.
#. Reduced memory usage when solving problems with dynamic sparsity.
#. ``CostFunctionToFunctor`` now supports dynamic number of residuals.
#. A complete re-write of the problem preprocessing phase.
#. ``Solver::Summary::FullReport`` now reports the build configuration
   for Ceres.
#. When building on Android, the ``NDK`` version detection logic has
   been improved.
#. The ``CERES_VERSION`` macro has been improved and replaced with the
   ``CERES_VERSION_STRING`` macro.
#. Added ``Solver::Options::IsValid`` which allows users to validate
   their solver configuration before calling ``Solve``.
#. Added ``Problem::GetCostFunctionForResidualBlock`` and
   ``Problem::GetLossFunctionForResidualBlock``.
#. Added Tukey's loss function. (Michael Vitus)
#. Added RotationMatrixToQuaternion
#. Compute & report timing information for line searches.
#. Autodetect gflags namespace.
#. Expanded ``more_garbow_hillstrom.cc``.
#. Added a pointer to Tal Ben-Nun's MSVC wrapper to the docs.
#. Added the ``<2,3,6>`` Schur template specialization. (Alessandro
   Dal Grande)

Backward Incompatible API Changes
---------------------------------
#. ``NumericDiffFunctor`` has been removed. It's API was broken, and
   the implementation was an unnecessary layer of abstraction over
   ``CostFunctionToFunctor``.
#. ``POLAK_RIBIRERE`` conjugate gradients direction type has been
   renamed to ``POLAK_RIBIERE``.
#. ``Solver::Options::solver_log`` has been removed. If needed this
   iteration callback can easily be implemented in user code.
#. The ``SPARSE_CHOLESKY`` algorithm for covariance estimation has
   been removed. It is not rank revealing and numerically poorly
   behaved. Sparse QR factorization is a much better way to do this.
#. The ``SPARSE_QR`` algorithm for covariance estimation has been
   renamed to ``SUITE_SPARSE_QR`` to be consistent with
   ``EIGEN_SPARSE_QR``.
#. ``Solver::Summary::preconditioner_type`` has been replaced with
   ``Solver::Summary::preconditioner_type_given`` and
   ``Solver::Summary::preconditioner_type_used`` to be more consistent
   with how information about the linear solver is communicated.
#. ``CERES_VERSION`` and ``CERES_ABI_VERSION`` macros were not
   terribly useful. They have been replaced with
   ``CERES_VERSION_MAJOR``, ``CERES_VERSION_MINOR`` ,
   ``CERES_VERSION_REVISION`` and ``CERES_VERSION_ABI`` macros. In
   particular the functionality of ``CERES_VERSION`` is provided by
   ``CERES_VERSION_STRING`` macro.

1.9.0
=====

New Features
------------

#. Bounds constraints: Support for upper and/or lower bounds on
   parameters when using the trust region minimizer.
#. Dynamic Sparsity: Problems in which the sparsity structure of the
   Jacobian changes over the course of the optimization can now be
   solved much more efficiently. (Richard Stebbing)
#. Improved support for Microsoft Visual C++ including the ability to
   build and ship DLLs. (Björn Piltz, Alex Stewart and Sergey
   Sharybin)
#. Support for building on iOS 6.0 or higher (Jack Feng).
#. Autogeneration of config.h that captures all the defines used to
   build and use Ceres Solver.
#. Simpler and more informative solver termination type
   reporting. (See below for more details)
#. New `website <http://www.ceres-solver.org>`_ based entirely on
   Sphinx.
#. ``AutoDiffLocalParameterization`` allows the use of automatic
   differentiation for defining ``LocalParameterization`` objects
   (Alex Stewart)
#. LBFGS is faster due to fewer memory copies.

#. Homography estimation example from Blender demonstrating the use of
   a custom ``IterationCallback``. (Sergey Sharybin)
#. Support user passing a custom CMAKE_MODULE_PATH (for BLAS /
   LAPACK).

Backward Incompatible API Changes
---------------------------------

#. ``Solver::Options::linear_solver_ordering`` used to be a naked
   pointer that Ceres took ownership of. This is error prone behaviour
   which leads to problems when copying the ``Solver::Options`` struct
   around. This has been replaced with a ``shared_ptr`` to handle
   ownership correctly across copies.

#. The enum used for reporting the termination/convergence status of
   the solver has been renamed from ``SolverTerminationType`` to
   ``TerminationType``.

   The enum values have also changed. ``FUNCTION_TOLERANCE``,
   ``GRADIENT_TOLERANCE`` and ``PARAMETER_TOLERANCE`` have all been
   replaced by ``CONVERGENCE``.

   ``NUMERICAL_FAILURE`` has been replaed by ``FAILURE``.

   ``USER_ABORT`` has been renamed to ``USER_FAILURE``.

   Further ``Solver::Summary::error`` has been renamed to
   ``Solver::Summary::message``. It contains a more detailed
   explanation for why the solver terminated.

#. ``Solver::Options::gradient_tolerance`` used to be a relative
   gradient tolerance. i.e., The solver converged when

   .. math::
      \|g(x)\|_\infty < \text{gradient_tolerance} * \|g(x_0)\|_\infty

   where :math:`g(x)` is the gradient of the objective function at
   :math:`x` and :math:`x_0` is the parmeter vector at the start of
   the optimization.

   This has changed to an absolute tolerance, i.e. the solver
   converges when

   .. math::
      \|g(x)\|_\infty < \text{gradient_tolerance}

#. Ceres cannot be built without the line search minimizer
   anymore. Thus the preprocessor define
   ``CERES_NO_LINE_SEARCH_MINIMIZER`` has been removed.

Bug Fixes
---------

#. Disabled warning C4251. (Björn Piltz)
#. Do not propagate 3d party libs through
   `IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_[DEBUG/RELEASE]` mechanism when
   building shared libraries. (Björn Piltz)
#. Fixed errant verbose levels (Björn Piltz)
#. Variety of code cleanups, optimizations and bug fixes to the line
   search minimizer code (Alex Stewart)
#. Fixed ``BlockSparseMatrix::Transpose`` when the matrix has row and
   column blocks. (Richard Bowen)
#. Better error checking when ``Problem::RemoveResidualBlock`` is
   called. (Alex Stewart)
#. Fixed a memory leak in ``SchurComplementSolver``.
#. Added ``epsilon()`` method to ``NumTraits<ceres::Jet<T, N> >``. (Filippo
   Basso)

   ``DeleteRows``.q
#. Handle empty problems consistently.
#. Restore the state of the ``Problem`` after a call to
   ``Problem::Evaluate``. (Stefan Leutenegger)
#. Better error checking and reporting for linear solvers.

   eigenvalue solver.
#. Fix constant parameter handling in inner iterations (Mikael
   Persson).
#. SuiteSparse errors do not cause a fatal crash anymore.
#. Fix ``corrector_test.cc``.
#. Relax the requirements on loss function derivatives.
#. Minor bugfix to logging.h (Scott Ettinger)
#. Updated ``gmock`` and ``gtest`` to the latest upstream version.
#. Fix build breakage on old versions of SuiteSparse.
#. Fixed build issues related to Clang / LLVM 3.4 (Johannes
   Schönberger)
#. METIS_FOUND is never set. Changed the commit to fit the setting of
   the other #._FOUND definitions. (Andreas Franek)
#. Variety of bug fixes and cleanups to the ``CMake`` build system
   (Alex Stewart)
#. Removed fictious shared library target from the NDK build.
#. Solver::Options now uses ``shared_ptr`` to handle ownership of
   ``Solver::Options::linear_solver_ordering`` and
   ``Solver::Options::inner_iteration_ordering``. As a consequence the
   ``NDK`` build now depends on ``libc++`` from the ``LLVM`` project.
#. Variety of lint cleanups (William Rucklidge & Jim Roseborough)
#. Various internal cleanups including dead code removal.


1.8.0
=====

New Features

1.7.0
=====

Backward Incompatible API Changes
---------------------------------

   optimized ``BLAS`` and ``LAPACK`` implementations (e.g., Intel MKL,
   ACML, OpenBLAS etc) can now be used to do the dense linear
   algebra for ``DENSE_QR``, ``DENSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY`` and
   ``DENSE_SCHUR``

#. Fix miniglog-based Android NDK build; now works with NDK r9. (Scott Ettinger)


1.6.0
=====

New Features
------------

#. Major Performance improvements.

   a. Schur type solvers (``SPARSE_SCHUR``, ``DENSE_SCHUR``,
      ``ITERATIVE_SCHUR``) are significantly faster due to custom BLAS
      routines and fewer heap allocations.

   b. ``SPARSE_SCHUR`` when used with ``CX_SPARSE`` now uses a block
      AMD for much improved factorization performance.

   c. The jacobian matrix is pre-ordered so that
      ``SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY`` and ``SPARSE_SCHUR`` do not have to
      make copies inside ``CHOLMOD``.

   d. Faster autodiff by replacing division by multplication by inverse.

   e. When compiled without threads, the schur eliminator does not pay
      the penalty for locking and unlocking mutexes.

#. Users can now use ``linear_solver_ordering`` to affect the
   fill-reducing ordering used by ``SUITE_SPARSE`` for
   ``SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY``.
#. ``Problem`` can now report the set of parameter blocks it knows about.
#. ``TrustRegionMinimizer`` uses the evaluator to compute the gradient
   instead of a matrix vector multiply.
#. On ``Mac OS``, whole program optimization is enabled.
#. Users can now use automatic differentiation to define new
   ``LocalParameterization`` objects. (Sergey Sharybin)
#. Enable larger tuple sizes for Visual Studio 2012. (Petter Strandmark)


Bug Fixes
---------

#. Update the documentation for ``CostFunction``.
#. Fixed a typo in the documentation. (Pablo Speciale)

#. ``<iterator>`` needed for back_insert_iterator. (Petter Strandmark)
#. Lint cleanup. (William Rucklidge)
#. Documentation corrections. (Pablo Speciale)


1.5.0
=====

Backward Incompatible API Changes
---------------------------------

#. Added ``Problem::Evaluate``. Now you can evaluate a problem or any
   part of it without calling the solver.

   In light of this the following settings have been deprecated and
   removed from the API.

   - ``Solver::Options::return_initial_residuals``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_initial_gradient``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_initial_jacobian``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_final_residuals``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_final_gradient``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_final_jacobian``

   Instead we recommend using something like this.

   .. code-block:: c++

     Problem problem;
     // Build problem

     vector<double> initial_residuals;
     problem.Evaluate(Problem::EvaluateOptions(),
                      NULL, /* No cost */
                      &initial_residuals,
                      NULL, /* No gradient */
                      NULL  /* No jacobian */ );

     Solver::Options options;
     Solver::Summary summary;
     Solver::Solve(options, &problem, &summary);

     vector<double> final_residuals;
     problem.Evaluate(Problem::EvaluateOptions(),
                      NULL, /* No cost */
                      &final_residuals,
                      NULL, /* No gradient */
                      NULL  /* No jacobian */ );


New Features
------------
#. Problem now supports removal of ParameterBlocks and
   ResidualBlocks. There is a space/time tradeoff in doing this which
   is controlled by
   ``Problem::Options::enable_fast_parameter_block_removal``.

#. Ceres now supports Line search based optimization algorithms in
   addition to trust region algorithms. Currently there is support for
   gradient descent, non-linear conjugate gradient and LBFGS search
   directions.
#. Added ``Problem::Evaluate``. Now you can evaluate a problem or any
   part of it without calling the solver. In light of this the
   following settings have been deprecated and removed from the API.

   - ``Solver::Options::return_initial_residuals``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_initial_gradient``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_initial_jacobian``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_final_residuals``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_final_gradient``
   - ``Solver::Options::return_final_jacobian``

#. New, much improved HTML documentation using Sphinx.
#. Changed ``NumericDiffCostFunction`` to take functors like
   ``AutoDiffCostFunction``.
#. Added support for mixing automatic, analytic and numeric
   differentiation. This is done by adding ``CostFunctionToFunctor``
   and ``NumericDiffFunctor`` objects to the API.
#. Sped up the robust loss function correction logic when residual is
   one dimensional.
#. Sped up ``DenseQRSolver`` by changing the way dense jacobians are
   stored. This is a 200-500% improvement in linear solver performance
   depending on the size of the problem.
#. ``DENSE_SCHUR`` now supports multi-threading.
#. Greatly expanded ``Summary::FullReport``:

   - Report the ordering used by the ``LinearSolver``.
   - Report the ordering used by the inner iterations.
   - Execution timing breakdown into evaluations and linear solves.
   - Effective size of the problem solved by the solver, which now
     accounts for the size of the tangent space when using a
     ``LocalParameterization``.
#. Ceres when run at the ``VLOG`` level 3 or higher will report
   detailed timing information about its internals.
#. Remove extraneous initial and final residual evaluations. This
   speeds up the solver a bit.
#. Automatic differenatiation with a dynamic number of parameter
   blocks. (Based on an idea by Thad Hughes).
#. Sped up problem construction and destruction.
#. Added matrix adapters to ``rotation.h`` so that the rotation matrix
   routines can work with row and column major matrices. (Markus Moll)
#. ``SCHUR_JACOBI`` can now be used without ``SuiteSparse``.
#. A ``.spec`` file for producing RPMs. (Taylor Braun-Jones)
#. ``CMake`` can now build the sphinx documentation (Pablo Speciale)
#. Add support for creating a CMake config file during build to make
   embedding Ceres in other CMake-using projects easier. (Pablo
   Speciale).
#. Better error reporting in ``Problem`` for missing parameter blocks.
#. A more flexible ``Android.mk`` and a more modular build. If binary
   size and/or compile time is a concern, larger parts of the solver
   can be disabled at compile time.

Bug Fixes
---------
#. Compilation fixes for MSVC2010 (Sergey Sharybin)
#. Fixed "deprecated conversion from string constant to char*"
   warnings. (Pablo Speciale)
#. Correctly propagate ifdefs when building without Schur eliminator
   template specializations.
#. Correct handling of ``LIB_SUFFIX`` on Linux. (Yuliy Schwartzburg).
#. Code and signature cleanup in ``rotation.h``.
#. Make examples independent of internal code.
#. Disable unused member in ``gtest`` which results in build error on
   OS X with latest Xcode. (Taylor Braun-Jones)
#. Pass the correct flags to the linker when using
   ``pthreads``. (Taylor Braun-Jones)
#. Only use ``cmake28`` macro when building on RHEL6. (Taylor
   Braun-Jones)
#. Remove ``-Wno-return-type-c-linkage`` when compiling with
   GCC. (Taylor Braun-Jones)
#. Fix ``No previous prototype`` warnings. (Sergey Sharybin)
#. MinGW build fixes. (Sergey Sharybin)
#. Lots of minor code and lint fixes. (William Rucklidge)
#. Fixed a bug in ``solver_impl.cc`` residual evaluation. (Markus
   Moll)
#. Fixed varidic evaluation bug in ``AutoDiff``.
#. Fixed ``SolverImpl`` tests.
#. Fixed a bug in ``DenseSparseMatrix::ToDenseMatrix()``.
#. Fixed an initialization bug in ``ProgramEvaluator``.
#. Fixes to Android.mk paths (Carlos Hernandez)
#. Modify ``nist.cc`` to compute accuracy based on ground truth
   solution rather than the ground truth function value.
#. Fixed a memory leak in ``cxsparse.cc``. (Alexander Mordvintsev).
#. Fixed the install directory for libraries by correctly handling
   ``LIB_SUFFIX``. (Taylor Braun-Jones)

New Features
------------

#. A new richer, more expressive and consistent API for ordering
   parameter blocks.
#. A non-linear generalization of Ruhe & Wedin's Algorithm II. This
   allows the user to use variable projection on separable and
   non-separable non-linear least squares problems. With
   multithreading, this results in significant improvements to the
   convergence behavior of the solver at a small increase in run time.
#. An image denoising example using fields of experts. (Petter
   Strandmark)
#. Defines for Ceres version and ABI version.
#. Higher precision timer code where available. (Petter Strandmark)
#. Example Makefile for users of Ceres.
#. IterationSummary now informs the user when the step is a
   non-monotonic step.
#. Fewer memory allocations when using ``DenseQRSolver``.
#. GradientChecker for testing CostFunctions (William Rucklidge)
#. Add support for cost functions with 10 parameter blocks in
   ``Problem``. (Fisher)
#. Add support for 10 parameter blocks in ``AutoDiffCostFunction``.

Origins
=======

Ceres Solver grew out of the need for general least squares solving at
Google. In early 2010, Sameer Agarwal and Fredrik Schaffalitzky
started the development of Ceres Solver. Fredrik left Google shortly
thereafter and Keir Mierle stepped in to take his place. After two
years of on-and-off development, Ceres Solver was released as open
source in May of 2012.
