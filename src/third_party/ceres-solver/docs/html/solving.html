<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Effective use of Ceres requires some familiarity with the basic
components of a nonlinear least squares solver, so before we describe
how to configure the solver, we will begin by taking a brief look at
how some of the core optimization algorithms in Ceres work and the
various linear solvers and preconditioners that power it.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> be an <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional vector of
variables, and
<span class="math">\(F(x) = \left[f_1(x), ... ,  f_{m}(x) \right]^{\top}\)</span> be a
<span class="math">\(m\)</span>-dimensional function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.  We are interested in
solving the following optimization problem <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a> .</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-nonlinsq">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[\arg \min_x \frac{1}{2}\|F(x)\|^2\ .\]</div>
<p>Here, the Jacobian <span class="math">\(J(x)\)</span> of <span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span> is an <span class="math">\(m\times
n\)</span> matrix, where <span class="math">\(J_{ij}(x) = \partial_j f_i(x)\)</span> and the
gradient vector <span class="math">\(g(x) = \nabla \frac{1}{2}\|F(x)\|^2 = J(x)^\top
F(x)\)</span>. Since the efficient global minimization of <a href="#equation-nonlinsq">(1)</a> for
general <span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span> is an intractable problem, we will have to settle
for finding a local minimum.</p>
<p>The general strategy when solving non-linear optimization problems is
to solve a sequence of approximations to the original problem
<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#nocedalwright">[NocedalWright]</a>. At each iteration, the approximation is solved to
determine a correction <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> to the vector <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. For
non-linear least squares, an approximation can be constructed by using
the linearization <span class="math">\(F(x+\Delta x) \approx F(x) + J(x)\Delta x\)</span>,
which leads to the following linear least squares problem:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-linearapprox">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[\min_{\Delta x} \frac{1}{2}\|J(x)\Delta x + F(x)\|^2\]</div>
<p>Unfortunately, naively solving a sequence of these problems and
updating <span class="math">\(x \leftarrow x+ \Delta x\)</span> leads to an algorithm that
may not converge.  To get a convergent algorithm, we need to control
the size of the step <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span>. Depending on how the size of
the step <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is controlled, non-linear optimization
algorithms can be divided into two major categories <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#nocedalwright">[NocedalWright]</a>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Trust Region</strong> The trust region approach approximates the
objective function using using a model function (often a quadratic)
over a subset of the search space known as the trust region. If the
model function succeeds in minimizing the true objective function
the trust region is expanded; conversely, otherwise it is
contracted and the model optimization problem is solved again.</li>
<li><strong>Line Search</strong> The line search approach first finds a descent
direction along which the objective function will be reduced and
then computes a step size that decides how far should move along
that direction. The descent direction can be computed by various
methods, such as gradient descent, Newton&#8217;s method and Quasi-Newton
method. The step size can be determined either exactly or
inexactly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Trust region methods are in some sense dual to line search methods:
trust region methods first choose a step size (the size of the trust
region) and then a step direction while line search methods first
choose a step direction and then a step size.</p>
<p>Ceres implements multiple algorithms in both categories.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trust-region-methods">
<span id="section-trust-region-methods"></span><h2>Trust Region Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#trust-region-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The basic trust region algorithm looks something like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Given an initial point <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and a trust region radius <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\arg \min_{\Delta x} \frac{1}{2}\|J(x)\Delta
x + F(x)\|^2\)</span> s.t. <span class="math">\(\|D(x)\Delta x\|^2 \le \mu\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\rho = \frac{\displaystyle \|F(x + \Delta x)\|^2 -
\|F(x)\|^2}{\displaystyle \|J(x)\Delta x + F(x)\|^2 -
\|F(x)\|^2}\)</span></li>
<li>if <span class="math">\(\rho &gt; \epsilon\)</span> then  <span class="math">\(x = x + \Delta x\)</span>.</li>
<li>if <span class="math">\(\rho &gt; \eta_1\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\rho = 2  \rho\)</span></li>
<li>else if <span class="math">\(\rho &lt; \eta_2\)</span> then <span class="math">\(\rho = 0.5 * \rho\)</span></li>
<li>Goto 2.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is the trust region radius, <span class="math">\(D(x)\)</span> is some
matrix used to define a metric on the domain of <span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> measures the quality of the step <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span>, i.e.,
how well did the linear model predict the decrease in the value of the
non-linear objective. The idea is to increase or decrease the radius
of the trust region depending on how well the linearization predicts
the behavior of the non-linear objective, which in turn is reflected
in the value of <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span>.</p>
<p>The key computational step in a trust-region algorithm is the solution
of the constrained optimization problem</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-trp">
<span class="eqno">(3)</span>\[\arg\min_{\Delta x} \frac{1}{2}\|J(x)\Delta x +  F(x)\|^2\quad \text{such that}\quad  \|D(x)\Delta x\|^2 \le \mu\]</div>
<p>There are a number of different ways of solving this problem, each
giving rise to a different concrete trust-region algorithm. Currently
Ceres, implements two trust-region algorithms - Levenberg-Marquardt
and Dogleg. The user can choose between them by setting

<div class="section" id="levenberg-marquardt">
<span id="section-levenberg-marquardt"></span><h3>Levenberg-Marquardt<a class="headerlink" href="#levenberg-marquardt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#levenberg">[Levenberg]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#marquardt">[Marquardt]</a> is the
most popular algorithm for solving non-linear least squares problems.
It was also the first trust region algorithm to be developed
<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#levenberg">[Levenberg]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#marquardt">[Marquardt]</a>. Ceres implements an exact step <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#madsen">[Madsen]</a>
and an inexact step variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#wrightholt">[WrightHolt]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#nashsofer">[NashSofer]</a>.</p>
<p>It can be shown, that the solution to <a href="#equation-trp">(3)</a> can be obtained by
solving an unconstrained optimization of the form</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\arg\min_{\Delta x}&amp; \frac{1}{2}\|J(x)\Delta x + F(x)\|^2 +\lambda  \|D(x)\Delta x\|^2\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Where, <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is a Lagrange multiplier that is inverse
related to <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>. In Ceres, we solve for</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-lsqr">
<span class="eqno">(4)</span>\[\begin{split}\arg\min_{\Delta x}&amp; \frac{1}{2}\|J(x)\Delta x + F(x)\|^2 + \frac{1}{\mu} \|D(x)\Delta x\|^2\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The matrix <span class="math">\(D(x)\)</span> is a non-negative diagonal matrix, typically
the square root of the diagonal of the matrix <span class="math">\(J(x)^\top J(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before going further, let us make some notational simplifications. We
will assume that the matrix <span class="math">\(\sqrt{\mu} D\)</span> has been concatenated
at the bottom of the matrix <span class="math">\(J\)</span> and similarly a vector of zeros
has been added to the bottom of the vector <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and the rest of
our discussion will be in terms of <span class="math">\(J\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, i.e, the
linear least squares problem.</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-simple">
<span class="eqno">(5)</span>\[\min_{\Delta x} \frac{1}{2} \|J(x)\Delta x + f(x)\|^2 .\]</div>
<p>For all but the smallest problems the solution of <a href="#equation-simple">(5)</a> in
each iteration of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the dominant
computational cost in Ceres. Ceres provides a number of different
options for solving <a href="#equation-simple">(5)</a>. There are two major classes of
methods - factorization and iterative.</p>
<p>The factorization methods are based on computing an exact solution of
<a href="#equation-lsqr">(4)</a> using a Cholesky or a QR factorization and lead to an exact
step Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. But it is not clear if an exact
solution of <a href="#equation-lsqr">(4)</a> is necessary at each step of the LM algorithm
to solve <a href="#equation-nonlinsq">(1)</a>. In fact, we have already seen evidence
that this may not be the case, as <a href="#equation-lsqr">(4)</a> is itself a regularized
version of <a href="#equation-linearapprox">(2)</a>. Indeed, it is possible to
construct non-linear optimization algorithms in which the linearized
problem is solved approximately. These algorithms are known as inexact
Newton or truncated Newton methods <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#nocedalwright">[NocedalWright]</a>.</p>
<p>An inexact Newton method requires two ingredients. First, a cheap
method for approximately solving systems of linear
equations. Typically an iterative linear solver like the Conjugate
Gradients method is used for this
purpose <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#nocedalwright">[NocedalWright]</a>. Second, a termination rule for
the iterative solver. A typical termination rule is of the form</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-inexact">
<span class="eqno">(6)</span>\[\|H(x) \Delta x + g(x)\| \leq \eta_k \|g(x)\|.\]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(k\)</span> indicates the Levenberg-Marquardt iteration number and
<span class="math">\(0 &lt; \eta_k &lt;1\)</span> is known as the forcing sequence.  <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#wrightholt">[WrightHolt]</a>
prove that a truncated Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that uses an
inexact Newton step based on <a href="#equation-inexact">(6)</a> converges for any
sequence <span class="math">\(\eta_k \leq \eta_0 &lt; 1\)</span> and the rate of convergence
depends on the choice of the forcing sequence <span class="math">\(\eta_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Ceres supports both exact and inexact step solution strategies. When
the user chooses a factorization based linear solver, the exact step
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used. When the user chooses an
iterative linear solver, the inexact step Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dogleg">
<span id="section-dogleg"></span><h3>Dogleg<a class="headerlink" href="#dogleg" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another strategy for solving the trust region problem <a href="#equation-trp">(3)</a> was
introduced by M. J. D. Powell. The key idea there is to compute two
vectors</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\Delta x^{\text{Gauss-Newton}} &amp;= \arg \min_{\Delta x}\frac{1}{2} \|J(x)\Delta x + f(x)\|^2.\\
\Delta x^{\text{Cauchy}} &amp;= -\frac{\|g(x)\|^2}{\|J(x)g(x)\|^2}g(x).\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Note that the vector <span class="math">\(\Delta x^{\text{Gauss-Newton}}\)</span> is the
solution to <a href="#equation-linearapprox">(2)</a> and <span class="math">\(\Delta
x^{\text{Cauchy}}\)</span> is the vector that minimizes the linear
approximation if we restrict ourselves to moving along the direction
of the gradient. Dogleg methods finds a vector <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span>
defined by <span class="math">\(\Delta x^{\text{Gauss-Newton}}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Delta
x^{\text{Cauchy}}\)</span> that solves the trust region problem. Ceres
supports two variants that can be chose by setting
<a class="reference internal" href="#Solver::Options::dogleg_type__DoglegType" title="Solver::Options::dogleg_type"><tt class="xref cpp cpp-member docutils literal"><span class="pre">Solver::Options::dogleg_type</span></tt></a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TRADITIONAL_DOGLEG</span></tt> as described by Powell, constructs two line
segments using the Gauss-Newton and Cauchy vectors and finds the point
farthest along this line shaped like a dogleg (hence the name) that is
contained in the trust-region. For more details on the exact reasoning
and computations, please see Madsen et al <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#madsen">[Madsen]</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUBSPACE_DOGLEG</span></tt> is a more sophisticated method that considers the
entire two dimensional subspace spanned by these two vectors and finds
the point that minimizes the trust region problem in this subspace
<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#byrdschnabel">[ByrdSchnabel]</a>.</p>
<p>The key advantage of the Dogleg over Levenberg Marquardt is that if
the step computation for a particular choice of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> does not
result in sufficient decrease in the value of the objective function,
Levenberg-Marquardt solves the linear approximation from scratch with
a smaller value of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>. Dogleg on the other hand, only needs
to compute the interpolation between the Gauss-Newton and the Cauchy
vectors, as neither of them depend on the value of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Dogleg method can only be used with the exact factorization based
linear solvers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inner-iterations">
<span id="section-inner-iterations"></span><h3>Inner Iterations<a class="headerlink" href="#inner-iterations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some non-linear least squares problems have additional structure in
the way the parameter blocks interact that it is beneficial to modify
the way the trust region step is computed. e.g., consider the
following regression problem</p>
<div class="math">
\[y = a_1 e^{b_1 x} + a_2 e^{b_3 x^2 + c_1}\]</div>
<p>Given a set of pairs <span class="math">\(\{(x_i, y_i)\}\)</span>, the user wishes to estimate
<span class="math">\(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that the expression on the left is linear in <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(a_2\)</span>, and given any value for <span class="math">\(b_1, b_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c_1\)</span>,
it is possible to use linear regression to estimate the optimal values
of <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span>. It&#8217;s possible to analytically
eliminate the variables <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span> from the problem
entirely. Problems like these are known as separable least squares
problem and the most famous algorithm for solving them is the Variable
Projection algorithm invented by Golub &amp; Pereyra <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#golubpereyra">[GolubPereyra]</a>.</p>
<p>Similar structure can be found in the matrix factorization with
missing data problem. There the corresponding algorithm is known as
Wiberg&#8217;s algorithm <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#wiberg">[Wiberg]</a>.</p>
<p>Ruhe &amp; Wedin present an analysis of various algorithms for solving
separable non-linear least squares problems and refer to <em>Variable
Projection</em> as Algorithm I in their paper <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#ruhewedin">[RuheWedin]</a>.</p>
<p>Implementing Variable Projection is tedious and expensive. Ruhe &amp;
Wedin present a simpler algorithm with comparable convergence
properties, which they call Algorithm II.  Algorithm II performs an
additional optimization step to estimate <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span>
exactly after computing a successful Newton step.</p>
<p>This idea can be generalized to cases where the residual is not
linear in <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span>, i.e.,</p>
<div class="math">
\[y = f_1(a_1, e^{b_1 x}) + f_2(a_2, e^{b_3 x^2 + c_1})\]</div>
<p>In this case, we solve for the trust region step for the full problem,
and then use it as the starting point to further optimize just <cite>a_1</cite>
and <cite>a_2</cite>. For the linear case, this amounts to doing a single linear
least squares solve. For non-linear problems, any method for solving
the <cite>a_1</cite> and <cite>a_2</cite> optimization problems will do. The only constraint
on <cite>a_1</cite> and <cite>a_2</cite> (if they are two different parameter block) is that
they do not co-occur in a residual block.</p>
<p>This idea can be further generalized, by not just optimizing
<span class="math">\((a_1, a_2)\)</span>, but decomposing the graph corresponding to the
Hessian matrix&#8217;s sparsity structure into a collection of
non-overlapping independent sets and optimizing each of them.</p>
<p>Setting <a class="reference internal" href="#Solver::Options::use_inner_iterations__b" title="Solver::Options::use_inner_iterations"><tt class="xref cpp cpp-member docutils literal"><span class="pre">Solver::Options::use_inner_iterations</span></tt></a> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt>
enables the use of this non-linear generalization of Ruhe &amp; Wedin&#8217;s
Algorithm II.  This version of Ceres has a higher iteration
complexity, but also displays better convergence behavior per
iteration.</p>

<span id="section-non-monotonic-steps"></span><h3>Non-monotonic Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#non-monotonic-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note that the basic trust-region algorithm described in
Algorithm~ref{alg:trust-region} is a descent algorithm in that they
only accepts a point if it strictly reduces the value of the objective
function.</p>
<p>Relaxing this requirement allows the algorithm to be more efficient in
the long term at the cost of some local increase in the value of the
objective function.</p>
<p>This is because allowing for non-decreasing objective function values
in a princpled manner allows the algorithm to <em>jump over boulders</em> as
the method is not restricted to move into narrow valleys while
preserving its convergence properties.</p>
<p>Setting <a class="reference internal" href="#Solver::Options::use_nonmonotonic_steps__b" title="Solver::Options::use_nonmonotonic_steps"><tt class="xref cpp cpp-member docutils literal"><span class="pre">Solver::Options::use_nonmonotonic_steps</span></tt></a> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt>
enables the non-monotonic trust region algorithm as described by Conn,
Gould &amp; Toint in <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#conn">[Conn]</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the value of the objective function may be larger
than the minimum value encountered over the course of the
optimization, the final parameters returned to the user are the
ones corresponding to the minimum cost over all iterations.</p>
<p>The option to take non-monotonic steps is available for all trust
region strategies.</p>

<p>While it is possible to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY</span></tt> to solve bundle
adjustment problems, bundle adjustment problem have a special
structure, and a more efficient scheme for solving <a href="#equation-normal">(8)</a>
can be constructed.</p>
<p>Suppose that the SfM problem consists of <span class="math">\(p\)</span> cameras and
<span class="math">\(q\)</span> points and the variable vector <span class="math">\(x\)</span> has the block
structure <span class="math">\(x = [y_{1}, ... ,y_{p},z_{1}, ... ,z_{q}]\)</span>. Where,
<span class="math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z\)</span> correspond to camera and point parameters,
respectively.  Further, let the camera blocks be of size <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and
the point blocks be of size <span class="math">\(s\)</span> (for most problems <span class="math">\(c\)</span> =
<span class="math">\(6\)</span>&#8211;<cite>9</cite> and <span class="math">\(s = 3\)</span>). Ceres does not impose any constancy
requirement on these block sizes, but choosing them to be constant
simplifies the exposition.</p>
<p>A key characteristic of the bundle adjustment problem is that there is
no term <span class="math">\(f_{i}\)</span> that includes two or more point blocks.  This in
turn implies that the matrix <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is of the form</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-hblock">
<span class="eqno">(9)</span>\[\begin{split}H = \left[ \begin{matrix} B &amp; E\\ E^\top &amp; C \end{matrix} \right]\ ,\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where, <span class="math">\(B \in \mathbb{R}^{pc\times pc}\)</span> is a block sparse matrix
with <span class="math">\(p\)</span> blocks of size <span class="math">\(c\times c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C \in
\mathbb{R}^{qs\times qs}\)</span> is a block diagonal matrix with <span class="math">\(q\)</span> blocks
of size <span class="math">\(s\times s\)</span>. <span class="math">\(E \in \mathbb{R}^{pc\times qs}\)</span> is a
general block sparse matrix, with a block of size <span class="math">\(c\times s\)</span>
for each observation. Let us now block partition <span class="math">\(\Delta x =
[\Delta y,\Delta z]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g=[v,w]\)</span> to restate <a href="#equation-normal">(8)</a>
as the block structured linear system</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-linear2">
<span class="eqno">(10)</span>\[\begin{split}\left[ \begin{matrix} B &amp; E\\ E^\top &amp; C \end{matrix}
             \right]\left[ \begin{matrix} \Delta y \\ \Delta z
                 \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} v\\ w
                 \end{matrix} \right]\ ,\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and apply Gaussian elimination to it. As we noted above, <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is
a block diagonal matrix, with small diagonal blocks of size
<span class="math">\(s\times s\)</span>.  Thus, calculating the inverse of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> by
inverting each of these blocks is cheap. This allows us to eliminate
<span class="math">\(\Delta z\)</span> by observing that <span class="math">\(\Delta z = C^{-1}(w - E^\top
\Delta y)\)</span>, giving us</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-schur">
<span class="eqno">(11)</span>\[\left[B - EC^{-1}E^\top\right] \Delta y = v - EC^{-1}w\ .\]</div>
<p>The matrix</p>
<div class="math">
\[S = B - EC^{-1}E^\top\]</div>
<p>is the Schur complement of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> in <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. It is also known as
the <em>reduced camera matrix</em>, because the only variables
participating in <a href="#equation-schur">(11)</a> are the ones corresponding to the
cameras. <span class="math">\(S \in \mathbb{R}^{pc\times pc}\)</span> is a block structured
symmetric positive definite matrix, with blocks of size <span class="math">\(c\times
c\)</span>. The block <span class="math">\(S_{ij}\)</span> corresponding to the pair of images
<span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span> is non-zero if and only if the two images
observe at least one common point.</p>
<p>Now, eq-linear2 can be solved by first forming <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, solving for
<span class="math">\(\Delta y\)</span>, and then back-substituting <span class="math">\(\Delta y\)</span> to
obtain the value of <span class="math">\(\Delta z\)</span>.  Thus, the solution of what was
an <span class="math">\(n\times n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n=pc+qs\)</span> linear system is reduced to the
inversion of the block diagonal matrix <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, a few matrix-matrix
and matrix-vector multiplies, and the solution of block sparse
<span class="math">\(pc\times pc\)</span> linear system <a href="#equation-schur">(11)</a>.  For almost all
problems, the number of cameras is much smaller than the number of
points, <span class="math">\(p \ll q\)</span>, thus solving <a href="#equation-schur">(11)</a> is
significantly cheaper than solving <a href="#equation-linear2">(10)</a>. This is the
<em>Schur complement trick</em> <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#brown">[Brown]</a>.</p>
<p>This still leaves open the question of solving <a href="#equation-schur">(11)</a>. The
method of choice for solving symmetric positive definite systems
exactly is via the Cholesky factorization <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#trefethenbau">[TrefethenBau]</a> and
depending upon the structure of the matrix, there are, in general, two
options. The first is direct factorization, where we store and factor
<span class="math">\(S\)</span> as a dense matrix <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#trefethenbau">[TrefethenBau]</a>. This method has
<span class="math">\(O(p^2)\)</span> space complexity and <span class="math">\(O(p^3)\)</span> time complexity and
is only practical for problems with up to a few hundred cameras. Ceres
implements this strategy as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DENSE_SCHUR</span></tt> solver.</p>
<p>But, <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is typically a fairly sparse matrix, as most images
only see a small fraction of the scene. This leads us to the second
option: Sparse Direct Methods. These methods store <span class="math">\(S\)</span> as a
sparse matrix, use row and column re-ordering algorithms to maximize
the sparsity of the Cholesky decomposition, and focus their compute
effort on the non-zero part of the factorization <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#chen">[Chen]</a>. Sparse
direct methods, depending on the exact sparsity structure of the Schur
complement, allow bundle adjustment algorithms to significantly scale
up over those based on dense factorization. Ceres implements this
strategy as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SPARSE_SCHUR</span></tt> solver.</p>

<p>Another option for bundle adjustment problems is to apply PCG to the
reduced camera matrix <span class="math">\(S\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. One reason to do
this is that <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is a much smaller matrix than <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, but
more importantly, it can be shown that <span class="math">\(\kappa(S)\leq
\kappa(H)\)</span>.  Cseres implements PCG on <span class="math">\(S\)</span> as the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ITERATIVE_SCHUR</span></tt> solver. When the user chooses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ITERATIVE_SCHUR</span></tt>
as the linear solver, Ceres automatically switches from the exact step
algorithm to an inexact step algorithm.</p>
<p>The cost of forming and storing the Schur complement <span class="math">\(S\)</span> can be
prohibitive for large problems. Indeed, for an inexact Newton solver
that computes <span class="math">\(S\)</span> and runs PCG on it, almost all of its time is
spent in constructing <span class="math">\(S\)</span>; the time spent inside the PCG
algorithm is negligible in comparison. Because PCG only needs access
to <span class="math">\(S\)</span> via its product with a vector, one way to evaluate
<span class="math">\(Sx\)</span> is to observe that</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}x_1 &amp;= E^\top x\end{split}\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}x_2 &amp;= C^{-1} x_1\end{split}\]</div>

<div class="math" id="equation-schurtrick1">
<span class="eqno">(12)</span>\[\begin{split}Sx &amp;= x_4 - x_3\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Thus, we can run PCG on <span class="math">\(S\)</span> with the same computational effort
per iteration as PCG on <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, while reaping the benefits of a
more powerful preconditioner. In fact, we do not even need to compute
<span class="math">\(H\)</span>, <a href="#equation-schurtrick1">(12)</a> can be implemented using just the columns
of <span class="math">\(J\)</span>.</p>
<p>Equation <a href="#equation-schurtrick1">(12)</a> is closely related to <em>Domain
Decomposition methods</em> for solving large linear systems that arise in
structural engineering and partial differential equations. In the
language of Domain Decomposition, each point in a bundle adjustment
problem is a domain, and the cameras form the interface between these
domains. The iterative solution of the Schur complement then falls
within the sub-category of techniques known as Iterative
Sub-structuring <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#saad">[Saad]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#mathew">[Mathew]</a>.</p>

<p>The convergence rate of Conjugate Gradients for
solving <a href="#equation-normal">(8)</a> depends on the distribution of eigenvalues
of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#saad">[Saad]</a>. A useful upper bound is
<span class="math">\(\sqrt{\kappa(H)}\)</span>, where, <span class="math">\(\kappa(H)\)</span> is the condition
number of the matrix <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. For most bundle adjustment problems,
<span class="math">\(\kappa(H)\)</span> is high and a direct application of Conjugate
Gradients to <a href="#equation-normal">(8)</a> results in extremely poor performance.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to replace <a href="#equation-normal">(8)</a> with a
<em>preconditioned</em> system.  Given a linear system, <span class="math">\(Ax =b\)</span> and a
preconditioner <span class="math">\(M\)</span> the preconditioned system is given by
<span class="math">\(M^{-1}Ax = M^{-1}b\)</span>. The resulting algorithm is known as
Preconditioned Conjugate Gradients algorithm (PCG) and its worst case
complexity now depends on the condition number of the <em>preconditioned</em>
matrix <span class="math">\(\kappa(M^{-1}A)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The computational cost of using a preconditioner <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is the cost
of computing <span class="math">\(M\)</span> and evaluating the product <span class="math">\(M^{-1}y\)</span> for
arbitrary vectors <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. Thus, there are two competing factors to
consider: How much of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>&#8216;s structure is captured by <span class="math">\(M\)</span>
so that the condition number <span class="math">\(\kappa(HM^{-1})\)</span> is low, and the
computational cost of constructing and using <span class="math">\(M\)</span>.  The ideal
preconditioner would be one for which <span class="math">\(\kappa(M^{-1}A)
=1\)</span>. <span class="math">\(M=A\)</span> achieves this, but it is not a practical choice, as
applying this preconditioner would require solving a linear system
equivalent to the unpreconditioned problem.  It is usually the case
that the more information <span class="math">\(M\)</span> has about <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, the more
expensive it is use. For example, Incomplete Cholesky factorization
based preconditioners have much better convergence behavior than the
Jacobi preconditioner, but are also much more expensive.</p>
<p>The simplest of all preconditioners is the diagonal or Jacobi
preconditioner, i.e., <span class="math">\(M=\operatorname{diag}(A)\)</span>, which for
block structured matrices like <span class="math">\(H\)</span> can be generalized to the
block Jacobi preconditioner.</p>
<p>For <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ITERATIVE_SCHUR</span></tt> there are two obvious choices for block
diagonal preconditioners for <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. The block diagonal of the
matrix <span class="math">\(B\)</span> <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#mandel">[Mandel]</a> and the block diagonal <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, i.e, the
block Jacobi preconditioner for <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. Ceres&#8217;s implements both of
these preconditioners and refers to them as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">JACOBI</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SCHUR_JACOBI</span></tt> respectively.</p>
<p>For bundle adjustment problems arising in reconstruction from
community photo collections, more effective preconditioners can be
constructed by analyzing and exploiting the camera-point visibility
structure of the scene [KushalAgarwal]. Ceres implements the two
visibility based preconditioners described by Kushal &amp; Agarwal as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CLUSTER_JACOBI</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CLUSTER_TRIDIAGONAL</span></tt>. These are fairly new
preconditioners and Ceres&#8217; implementation of them is in its early
stages and is not as mature as the other preconditioners described
above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ordering">
<span id="section-ordering"></span><h3>Ordering<a class="headerlink" href="#ordering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The order in which variables are eliminated in a linear solver can
have a significant of impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the
method. For example when doing sparse Cholesky factorization, there
are matrices for which a good ordering will give a Cholesky factor
with <span class="math">\(O(n)\)</span> storage, where as a bad ordering will result in an
completely dense factor.</p>
<p>Ceres allows the user to provide varying amounts of hints to the
solver about the variable elimination ordering to use. This can range
from no hints, where the solver is free to decide the best ordering
based on the user&#8217;s choices like the linear solver being used, to an
exact order in which the variables should be eliminated, and a variety
of possibilities in between.</p>
<p>Instances of the <a class="reference internal" href="#ParameterBlockOrdering" title="ParameterBlockOrdering"><tt class="xref cpp cpp-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">ParameterBlockOrdering</span></tt></a> class are used to
communicate this information to Ceres.</p>
<p>Formally an ordering is an ordered partitioning of the parameter
blocks. Each parameter block belongs to exactly one group, and each
group has a unique integer associated with it, that determines its
order in the set of groups. We call these groups <em>Elimination Groups</em></p>
<p>Given such an ordering, Ceres ensures that the parameter blocks in the
lowest numbered elimination group are eliminated first, and then the
parameter blocks in the next lowest numbered elimination group and so
on. Within each elimination group, Ceres is free to order the
parameter blocks as it chooses. e.g. Consider the linear system</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}x + y &amp;= 3\\
2x + 3y &amp;= 7\end{split}\]</div>
<p>There are two ways in which it can be solved. First eliminating
<span class="math">\(x\)</span> from the two equations, solving for y and then back
substituting for <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, or first eliminating <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, solving
for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and back substituting for <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. The user can
construct three orderings here.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\{0: x\}, \{1: y\}\)</span> : Eliminate <span class="math">\(x\)</span> first.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\{0: y\}, \{1: x\}\)</span> : Eliminate <span class="math">\(y\)</span> first.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\{0: x, y\}\)</span>        : Solver gets to decide the elimination order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to have Ceres determine the ordering automatically using
heuristics, put all the variables in the same elimination group. The
identity of the group does not matter. This is the same as not
specifying an ordering at all. To control the ordering for every
variable, create an elimination group per variable, ordering them in
the desired order.</p>
<p>If the user is using one of the Schur solvers (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DENSE_SCHUR</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SPARSE_SCHUR</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ITERATIVE_SCHUR</span></tt>) and chooses to specify an
ordering, it must have one important property. The lowest numbered
elimination group must form an independent set in the graph
corresponding to the Hessian, or in other words, no two parameter
blocks in in the first elimination group should co-occur in the same
residual block. For the best performance, this elimination group
should be as large as possible. For standard bundle adjustment
problems, this corresponds to the first elimination group containing
all the 3d points, and the second containing the all the cameras
parameter blocks.</p>
<p>If the user leaves the choice to Ceres, then the solver uses an
approximate maximum independent set algorithm to identify the first
elimination group <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#lisaad">[LiSaad]</a>.</p>

<p>The LBFGS hessian approximation is a low rank approximation to the
inverse of the Hessian matrix. The rank of the approximation
determines (linearly) the space and time complexity of using the
approximation. Higher the rank, the better is the quality of the
approximation. The increase in quality is however is bounded for a
number of reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The method only uses secant information and not actual
derivatives.</li>
<li>The Hessian approximation is constrained to be positive
definite.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So increasing this rank to a large number will cost time and space
complexity without the corresponding increase in solution
quality. There are no hard and fast rules for choosing the maximum
rank. The best choice usually requires some problem specific
experimentation.</p>

<p>Relative shift used for taking numeric derivatives. For finite
differencing, each dimension is evaluated at slightly shifted
values, e.g., for forward differences, the numerical derivative is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\delta &amp;= numeric\_derivative\_relative\_step\_size\\
\Delta f &amp;= \frac{f((1 + \delta)  x) - f(x)}{\delta x}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The finite differencing is done along each dimension. The reason to
use a relative (rather than absolute) step size is that this way,
numeric differentiation works for functions where the arguments are
typically large (e.g. <span class="math">\(10^9\)</span>) and when the values are small
(e.g. <span class="math">\(10^{-5}\)</span>). It is possible to construct <em>torture cases</em>
which break this finite difference heuristic, but they do not come
up often in practice.</p>
