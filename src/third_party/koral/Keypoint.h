//
// ## Summary ##
// KORAL is a novel, extremely fast, highly accurate, scale- and
// rotation-invariant, CPU-GPU cooperative detector-descriptor.
//
// Detection is based on the author's custom multi-scale KFAST corner
// detector, with rapid bilinear interpolation performed by the GPU
// asynchronously while the CPU works on KFAST.
//
// ## Usage ##
// Basic use of KORAL is extremely easy, although, of course, for a
// larger high-performance pipeline, users will benefit from
// calling KORAL functions directly and modifying it to suit their needs.
//
// To detect and describe, simply #include "KORAL.h" and
// then do:
//
// 	    KORAL koral(scale_factor, scale_levels);
//      koral.go(image, width, height, KFAST_threshold);
//
// where scale_factor is the factor by which each scale leve
// is reduced from the previous, scale_levels is the total
// number of such scale levels used, image is a pointer to
// uint8_t (grayscale) image data, and KFAST_threshold
// is the threshold supplied to the KFAST feature detector.
//
// After this call, keypoints are avaiable in a vector at 
// koral.kps, while descriptors are available at
// koral.desc.
//
// Portions of KORAL require SSE, AVX, AVX2, and CUDA.
// The author is working on reduced-performance versions
// with lesser requirements, but as the intent of this work
// is primarily novel performance capability, modern
// hardware and this full version are highly recommended.
//
// Description is performed by the GPU using the novel CLATCH
// (CUDA LATCH) binary descriptor kernel.
//
// Rotation invariance is provided by a novel vectorized
// SSE angle weight detector.
//
// All components have been written and carefully tuned by the author
// for maximum performance and have no external dependencies. Some have
// been modified for integration into KORAL,
// but the original standalone projects are all availble on
// the author's GitHub (https://github.com/komrad36).
//
// These individual components are:
// -KFAST        (https://github.com/komrad36/KFAST)
// -CUDALERP     (https://github.com/komrad36/CUDALERP)
// -FeatureAngle (https://github.com/komrad36/FeatureAngle)
// -CLATCH       (https://github.com/komrad36/CLATCH)
//
// In addition, the natural next step of matching descriptors
// is available in the author's currently separate
// project, CUDAK2NN (https://github.com/komrad36/CUDAK2NN).
//
// A key insight responsible for much of the performance of
// this insanely fast system is due to Christopher Parker
// (https://github.com/csp256), to whom I am extremely grateful.
// 
// The file 'main.cpp' is a simple test driver
// illustrating example usage.It requires OpenCV
// for image read and keypoint display.KORAL itself,
// however, does not require OpenCV or any other
// external dependencies.
//
// Note that KORAL is a work in progress.
// Suggestions and improvements are welcomed.
