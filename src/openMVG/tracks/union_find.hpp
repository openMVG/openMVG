// Union-Find/Disjoint-Set data structure
//--
// A disjoint-set data structure also called a union–find data structure
// or merge–find set, is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements
// partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
// It supports two operations:
// - Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in.
//   - It returns an item from this set that serves as its "representative";
// - Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
// Sometime a Connected method is implemented:
// - Connected:
//   - By comparing the result of two Find operations, one can determine whether
//      two elements are in the same subset.
