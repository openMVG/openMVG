// Implements [1]: the *Tree-based Morse Regions* (TBMR) local
// feature detector.
// This detector extracts as features the connected components of the level 
// sets of the input intensity image. Among all such regions, the ones that
// are maximally topological equivalent to the critical regions (based on 
// Morse theory) are selected.
// TBMRs are affine co-variant, as well as largely co-variant to generic
// diffeomorphic transformations, and truly invariant to affine contrast 
// changes.
