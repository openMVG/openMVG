# Config file for OpenMVG library - Find OpenMVG & dependencies.
#
# This file is used by CMake when FIND_PACKAGE( OpenMVG ) is invoked (and
# the directory containing this file is present in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH).
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# OPENMVG_FOUND: True if OpenMVG has been successfully found.
#
# OPENMVG_VERSION: Version of OpenMVG found.
#
# OPENMVG_INCLUDE_DIRS: Include directories for OpenMVG and the
#                       dependencies which appear in the OpenMVG public
#                       API and are thus required to use OpenMVG.
#
# OPENMVG_LIBRARIES: Libraries for OpenMVG and all
#                    dependencies against which OpenMVG was
#                    compiled.

# Called if we failed to find Ceres or any of it's required dependencies,
# unsets all public (designed to be used externally) variables and reports
# error message at priority depending upon [REQUIRED/QUIET/<NONE>] argument.
