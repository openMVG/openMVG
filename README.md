Introduction
------------

[OpenMVG (Multiple View Geometry)](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~moulonp/openMVG/) "open Multiple View Geometry" is a library for computer-vision scientists and especially targeted to the Multiple View Geometry community. It is designed to provide an easy access to the classical problem solvers in Multiple View Geometry and solve them accurately.

The openMVG credo is: "Keep it simple, keep it maintainable". OpenMVG targets readable code that is easy to use and modify by the community.

All the features and modules are unit tested. This test driven development ensures that the code works as it should and enables more consistent repeatability. Furthermore, it makes it easier for the user to understand and learn the given features.
