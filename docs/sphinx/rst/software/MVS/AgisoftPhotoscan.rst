Export to Agisoft Photoscan
**********************************

Once a 3D calibration has been computed you can convert the SfM_Ouput files to a Agisoft Photoscan project.

OpenMVG exports camera information ready to be used in a photoscan project.

1. Export the OpenMVG camera information to either photoscan format or bundler format (thanks to the PMVS exporter).

.. code-block:: c++

  $ openMVG_main_openMVG2Agisoft -i <Dataset_Path>/sfm_data.bin -o <Dataset_Path>/AgisoftPhotoscan/

.. code-block:: c++

  $ openMVG_main_openMVG2PMVS -i <Dataset_Path>/sfm_data.bin -o <Dataset_Path>/PMVS

2. Open Photoscan
3. Add a chunk
4. Add the photos used by your OpenMVG project
5. Import cameras

- Use `Agisoft XML (*.out)` file type for loading the `cameras.xml` file generated by `openMVG_main_openMVG2Agisoft`.

  - It will load the camera intrinsic, extrinsics, compute the features and matches and triangulate features.

- Or use `Bundler (*.out)` file type to load the `bundle.rd.out` file generated by `openMVG_main_openMVG2PMVS`.

  - It will load the cameras intrinsics, extrinsics and the 3D point and their image observations.

6. Perform the processing operation of your choice within Photoscan.
