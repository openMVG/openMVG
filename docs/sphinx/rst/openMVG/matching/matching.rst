Nearest neighbor search
========================

We provide a generic interface to perform:

* **Nearest neighbor search (NNS)**
* **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)**

Three implementations are available:

* a Brute force,
* an Approximate Nearest Neighbor [FLANN]_,
* a Cascade hashing Nearest Neighbor [CASCADEHASHING]_.
* an approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs [HNSW]_.

This module works for data of any dimensionality, it could be use to search nearest neighbors for:

* Point coordinates (2d, 3d, nd),
* Feature descriptors (64, 128, nd).

Note:

* Since the distance metric is configurable you can use it with Scalar (L1, L2, .. distance), or binary vector (Hamming distance).

Using the **Nearest neighbor search (NNS)** let you find pairs of elements (``(i,j)``) from sets ``A`` and ``B`` that are the closest for a given metric ``d``:

.. math::

  \lbrace (P^i_A,P^j_B): j = \underset{k} {\mathrm{argmin}} \quad d(\text{desc}(P^i_A), \text{desc}(P^k_B)) \rbrace

Using the **K-NN** will return you tuple of elements: ``(i;(j,k))`` if 2 nearest values have been asked for the Inth query.

Example of usage:

.. code-block:: c++


  // Setup the matcher
  ArrayMatcherBruteForce<float> matcher;
  // The reference array
  float array[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
  // Setup the reference array of the matcher
  matcher.Build(array, 5, 1);

  //--
  // Looking for the nearest neighbor:
  //--
  // Perform a query to look which point is closest to 1.8
  float query[] = {1.8f};
  int nIndice = -1;
  float fDistance = -1.0f;
  matcher.SearchNeighbour(query, &nIndice, &fDistance);

  //  nIndice == 2 ; // index of the found nearest neighbor
  //  fDistance == 0.4; // squared distance

  //--
  // Looking for the K=2 nearest neighbor
  //--
  IndMatches vec_nIndices;
  vector<float> vec_fDistance;
  const int K = 2;
  matcher.SearchNeighbours(query, 1, &vec_nIndices, &vec_fDistance, K);

  // vec_nIndices = {IndMatch(0,2), IndMatche(0,1)};


Metric customization
====================

* L2 (used by default):

.. math::
  d(x,y):=\| x-y \|_2

* i.e L1 for binary descriptor (Hamming distance),

.. math::
  d(x,y) = \sum(x \oplus y)

* user customized distance (L1, ...).

Image domain, correspondences filtering (KVLD)
===============================================

When used with descriptors found putative matches can be filtered thanks to different filters:

* Symmetric distance (Left-Right check).

  * Keep only mutal correspondences: a match is kept if it is the same in the A->B and B->A order.

.. math::
  \lbrace (P^i_A,P^j_B): j = \underset{k} {\mathrm{argmin}} ~ d(\text{desc}(P^i_A), \text{desc}(P^k_B)), i = \underset{k} \min ~ d(\text{desc}(P^k_A), \text{desc}(P^j_B))
  \rbrace


* "Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio" distance check can be performed to remove repetitive elements.

  * As many nearest points have been asked we can measure the similarity between the N-nearest neighbor. If the ratio of distance is inferior to a threshold ``\delta`` the match is kept else it is rejected (since the risk of confusion is higher). It allows to avoid ambiguous correspondences. ``\delta`` is often chosen between ``0.6`` and ``0.8``.

.. math::
  \lbrace (P^i_A,P^j_B): j = \underset{k} {\mathrm{argmin}} ~ d(\text{desc}(P^i_A), \text{desc}(P^k_B)) < \delta \underset{k\neq j} \min ~ d(\text{desc}(P^i_A), \text{desc}(P^k_B))
  \rbrace

* K-VLD Filter (K-Virtual Line Descriptor) [KVLD12]_

  * A virtual segment (a segment/line between two points) is kept if at least one of it's supporting point is linked to K virtual segments. It produces a coherent photometric graph of the features from the set of points ``A`` and ``B``. Below: Top (SIFT putative matches found by NNS), Bottom: K-VLD coherent matches.
