OpenMVG (Multiple View Geometry) is a library for computer-vision scientists and targeted for the Multiple View Geometry community.

It is designed to provide an easy access to:

* Accurate Multiple View Geometry problem solvers,
* Tiny libraries to perform tasks from feature detection/matching to Structure from Motion,
* Complete Structure from Motion pipelines.


Why another library
-------------------

The openMVG credo is **"Keep it simple, keep it maintainable".**.
It means provide a readable code that is easy to use and modify by the community.

All the **features and modules are unit-tested**.
This test driven development ensures:

* more consistent repeatability (assert code works as it should in time),
* that the code is used in a real context to show how it should be used.

openMVG overview
-------------------------

OpenMVG is cut in various modules:

* **Libraries**, core modules,

  * comes with unit tests that assert algorithms results and show how use the code.

* **Samples**,

  * show how to use the library to build high_level algorithms.

* **Softwares**,

  *  ready to use tools to perform toolchain processing:

    * features matching in un-ordered photo collection,
    * SfM: tools and Structure from Motion pipelines,
    * color harmonization of photo collection.
