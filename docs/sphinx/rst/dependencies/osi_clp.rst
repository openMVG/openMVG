USAGE
========

openMVG uses the [OSI]_ and the [CLP]_ solver in order to solve linear programs [LP]_.

CLP has been chosen because it is known to support problems of up to 1.5 million constraints [CLP FAQ]_.

[LPSOLVE]_ has been tested but tests shown that it is less reliable (sometimes, there is no convergence to a solution).

Description
===========

[OSI]_
  Osi (Open Solver Interface) provides an abstract base class to a generic linear programming (LP) solver, along with derived classes for specific solvers. Many applications may be able to use the Osi to insulate themselves from a specific LP solver. (CLP and MOSEK backend are supported in openMVG).

[CLP]_
  Clp (Coin-or linear programming) is an open-source linear programming solver written in C++.
